<p>
    The aim of this thesis is to improve seamlessness of free and unbounded visual exploration of large-scale
    measurement data in a distributed system.

    In particular, it is focused on the usability of user interface which has noticeable impact on the quality of visual
    data analysis being an integral part of measurement data validation.
</p>

<p>
    The platforms, tools, mechanisms and algorithms supporting the visualization of large-scale measurement data has
    been reviewed.

    It has been noted that while the visualization and access to large amounts of measurement data via web browsers is
    not a technological issue, ensuring seamless visual exploration is a challenge to hide from the user the
    negative effects of computer network delays.
</p>

<p>
    A JavaScript library solution has been proposed and implemented that enables seamless, free and unbounded time
    series navigation by introducing progressive display techniques, multi-level cache and prefetch-based mechanisms
    known from distributed systems.

    The solution was tested on six selected visualization libraries for performance, usability, data access efficiency
    and overall user experience.
</p>

<p>
    A research tool has been created to evaluate the solution in terms of usability and performance.

    An interactive online survey was conducted in which survey respondents were able to compare different versions of
    the solution.
    The ease of integration of the solution with existing systems was also assessed.

    Performance tests have also been performed to show whether the proposed solution does not aggravate other
    performance parameters of the visualization system.
</p>

<p>
    The results indicated that the proposed solution greatly improved the visual data exploration flow, which was also
    noticed and appreciated by the participants in the study.

    However, improving this seamlessness was achieved at the expense of increasing the data stream provided to the
    visualization and slightly increasing the resource consumption on the browser side.

    Application of the solution in practice improves the adaptation of existing web user interfaces to the exploration
    of large-scale measurement data, which is reflected in the quality of visual analysis of data.
